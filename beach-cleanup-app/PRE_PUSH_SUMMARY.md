## 📋 Before You Push - Checklist

### 1. Verify Nothing Sensitive is Committed

```bash
cd beach-cleanup-app

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Make sure these are NOT staged:
# ❌ .env
# ❌ ocean-cleanup-service-account.json
# ❌ Any files with API keys

# If they are, remove them:
git reset HEAD .env
git reset HEAD server_py/ocean-cleanup-service-account.json
```

### 2. Test the Current Setup

```bash
# Verify everything works
./verify-setup.sh

# Test image upload
# 1. Start both servers
# 2. Upload a post with image
# 3. Verify image appears in feed
# 4. Check Google Sheet has the post
```

### 3. Prepare Credentials for Team

You need to send your team **2 files**:

#### File 1: `.env`
**Location:** `beach-cleanup-app/.env`

```bash
# Create a copy to review
cp .env .env.team-copy

# Review it to make sure all values are filled in
cat .env.team-copy
```

**Send this file securely** (see "How to Share Credentials" below)

#### File 2: `ocean-cleanup-service-account.json`
**Location:** `beach-cleanup-app/server_py/ocean-cleanup-service-account.json`

```bash
# Verify it exists
ls -la server_py/ocean-cleanup-service-account.json
```

**Send this file securely** (see "How to Share Credentials" below)

### 4. How to Share Credentials

**Recommended Methods:**

1. **Password Manager with Sharing** (Best)
   - 1Password Teams
   - Bitwarden Organizations
   - LastPass Teams

2. **Encrypted Messaging**
   - Signal (with disappearing messages)
   - ProtonMail (encrypted email)
   - Keybase (encrypted files)

3. **Secure File Sharing**
   - SpiderOak (encrypted)
   - Tresorit (encrypted)
   - Share via password manager

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Email the files
- ❌ Paste in Slack/Discord
- ❌ Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox without encryption
- ❌ Commit to Git

### 5. Grant Google Sheet Access

Add team members as **Viewers** to the Google Sheet:

1. Open: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5Ufho432M3KiF21JFbCSkDCsoqj8KMEntVNmvKpJOg
2. Click "Share"
3. Add team member emails
4. Set permission: **Viewer**
5. Click "Send"

They don't need edit access - the backend handles writes.

## 📤 When You're Ready to Push

```bash
cd beach-cleanup-app

# 1. Review changes
git status
git diff

# 2. Double-check no credentials
git status | grep -E "\.env|service-account"
# Should be empty!

# 3. Add files
git add .

# 4. Check staged files again
git status
# Make sure .env and JSON files are NOT there!

# 5. Commit
git commit -m "Add Firebase Storage integration and team setup docs

- Implemented Firebase Storage for image uploads
- Images now properly uploaded and displayed
- CORS configured for Firebase Storage
- Added comprehensive team setup documentation
- Updated .env.example with all required variables
- Created verification script for team onboarding"

# 6. Push
git push origin main
```

## 📧 Message to Send Your Team

After pushing, send this message (customize as needed):

```
Subject: Beach Cleanup App - Setup Instructions

Hi Team! 👋

I've just pushed the latest code with image upload functionality. Here's what you need to get started:

📦 SETUP REQUIREMENTS:

I'll send you 2 files separately via [secure method]:
1. .env - Environment configuration
2. ocean-cleanup-service-account.json - Backend credentials

Place them in:
- .env → beach-cleanup-app/
- ocean-cleanup-service-account.json → beach-cleanup-app/server_py/

📚 DOCUMENTATION:

After cloning the repo, check:
- TEAM_SETUP.md - Full setup guide
- ONBOARDING_MESSAGE.md - Quick start (5 minutes)
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Daily commands

🚀 QUICK START:

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone [repo-url]
cd beach-cleanup-app

# Add the 2 files I'll send you
# Then:

npm install
cd server_py && pip3 install -r ../requirements.txt && cd ..
./verify-setup.sh

# Terminal 1
cd server_py && python3 -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2
npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:5173

📊 GOOGLE SHEET ACCESS:

You've been added as a viewer to the Google Sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5Ufho432M3KiF21JFbCSkDCsoqj8KMEntVNmvKpJOg

🔐 CREDENTIALS:

I'll send the .env and JSON files via [method] shortly.
DO NOT commit these files to Git!

❓ QUESTIONS:

If you hit any issues:
1. Run ./verify-setup.sh
2. Check TEAM_SETUP.md
3. Ask in team chat

Let's build something awesome! 🌊
```

## 🔧 Post-Push Support

When team members ask for help:

### Common Issue: Images Not Loading

If someone reports images aren't loading, it's likely CORS. Have them run:

```bash
cd beach-cleanup-app
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://ocean-cleanup-476302.firebasestorage.app
```

They'll need to authenticate with Google Cloud SDK first:
```bash
gcloud auth login
```

### Common Issue: Backend Won't Start

Check they have the service account JSON in the right place:
```bash
ls -la server_py/ocean-cleanup-service-account.json
```

### Common Issue: "Module Not Found"

```bash
# Backend
cd server_py && pip3 install -r ../requirements.txt

# Frontend
npm install
```

## 📊 What Your Team Can See

### They WILL Have Access To:
- ✅ Source code (GitHub)
- ✅ Google Sheet (Viewer)
- ✅ Frontend at localhost:5173
- ✅ Backend at localhost:8000

### They WON'T Need Access To:
- ❌ Google Cloud Console (you manage this)
- ❌ Firebase Console (you manage this)
- ❌ Service Account creation (already done)

## 🔒 Security Reminders

### If Credentials Are Exposed:

1. **Immediately** rotate the exposed credentials:
   - Generate new service account
   - Create new Firebase API keys
   - Update Google Sheets API key

2. **Notify team** to update their `.env` files

3. **Revoke** old credentials in Google Cloud Console

### Regular Security Practices:

- Review who has access to credentials quarterly
- Rotate service account keys annually
- Monitor Firebase Storage usage for anomalies
- Review Google Sheet access permissions

## ✅ Final Checklist

Before pushing, verify:

- [ ] Ran `git status` - no `.env` or `.json` files staged
- [ ] Tested image upload works locally
- [ ] Created copies of `.env` and service account JSON to send to team
- [ ] Decided how to securely share credentials
- [ ] Added team members as viewers to Google Sheet
- [ ] Reviewed commit message
- [ ] Read ONBOARDING_MESSAGE.md to understand what team will see
- [ ] Prepared welcome message for team

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Once you've checked everything above:

1. Push your code
2. Send credentials to team via secure method
3. Send the welcome message
4. Be available for questions

Your team will be up and running in 5 minutes!
