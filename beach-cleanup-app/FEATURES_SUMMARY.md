# Google Maps & Notifications Features - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully added comprehensive location-based features to the OceanClean beach cleanup app, including Google Maps integration, real-time geolocation tracking, and push notifications for nearby cleanup events.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Google Maps Integration

**Location**: `src/components/EventsMap.jsx`

Features:
- Interactive Google Maps display with all cleanup events
- Custom markers for events (ocean blue) and user location (blue)
- Info windows with event details when clicking markers
- Responsive map container with zoom and fullscreen controls
- Direct "Join Event" action from map info windows
- Distance display for each event from user's location

### 2. Geolocation Service

**Location**: `src/services/geolocation.js`

Capabilities:
- Check and request location permissions
- Get current user position with high accuracy
- Watch position for continuous location updates
- Cross-platform support (web and mobile via Capacitor)
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Distance Calculations

**Location**: `src/utils/helpers.js`

Added utilities:
- `calculateDistance()` - Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
- `formatDistance()` - Human-readable distance formatting (meters/kilometers)
- `findNearbyEvents()` - Filter and sort events by proximity to user

### 4. Local Push Notifications

**Location**: `src/services/notifications.js`

Features:
- Check and request notification permissions
- Schedule local notifications for nearby events
- Smart notification logic (closest event + count of multiple events)
- Action listeners for notification taps
- Support for Android and iOS (via Capacitor)

### 5. Enhanced Events Page

**Location**: `src/pages/Events.jsx`

New UI Elements:
- **Map/List Toggle**: Switch between list view and map view
- **Notifications Toggle**: Enable/disable nearby event alerts
- **Location Status Banner**: Shows location detection status
- **Distance Badges**: Display distance to each event on cards
- **Enable Location Button**: Quick action to request permissions

New Functionality:
- Automatic location detection on page load
- Real-time distance calculation for all events
- Notification check when location/events update
- Smart filtering with distance data

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@react-google-maps/api": "^2.20.7",
  "@capacitor/geolocation": "^7.1.5",
  "@capacitor/local-notifications": "^7.0.3"
}
```

## Capacitor Configuration

Added plugin configurations for Android:

**Geolocation**:
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` - Precise GPS location
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - Approximate location

**Local Notifications**:
- Custom icon color (ocean blue)
- Notification sound
- Android 13+ notification permissions

## User Flow

### Web Browser Flow:
1. User navigates to Events page
2. Browser requests location permission
3. App detects location and shows distance to events
4. User can toggle between List and Map views
5. User can enable notifications for nearby events (within 5km)
6. When notifications are on, app checks for nearby events
7. Push notification sent if events are within radius

### Android App Flow:
1. User opens app and navigates to Events
2. App requests native location permissions
3. App requests notification permissions
4. Location tracked via native GPS (more accurate than web)
5. Same notification logic as web
6. Notifications appear in Android notification tray
7. Tapping notification opens Events page

## Key Technologies

- **Google Maps JavaScript API**: Map rendering and markers
- **Capacitor Geolocation**: Native GPS access
- **Capacitor Local Notifications**: Native push notifications
- **Haversine Formula**: Accurate distance calculations
- **React Hooks**: State management (useState, useEffect)
- **Vite Environment Variables**: Secure API key handling

## Testing Checklist

### Web (Development)
- [ ] Location permission prompt appears
- [ ] User location marker shows on map
- [ ] Event markers clickable with info windows
- [ ] Distance displayed on event cards
- [ ] Notifications toggle works
- [ ] Notification appears for nearby events

### Android
- [ ] Native location permission dialog
- [ ] Notification permission dialog
- [ ] GPS location more accurate than web
- [ ] Notifications appear in Android tray
- [ ] Tapping notification opens app
- [ ] Location persists when app backgrounds

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**:
   - Stored in `.env` file (gitignored)
   - Should be restricted in Google Cloud Console
   - Different keys for dev/production recommended

2. **Permissions**:
   - Location requested only when needed
   - Clear messaging about why permissions needed
   - Graceful fallback if permissions denied

3. **Privacy**:
   - Location not stored or transmitted
   - Used only for distance calculations
   - No background tracking implemented

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Map component only loaded when needed
2. **Memoization**: Map center and options memoized with useMemo
3. **Efficient Filtering**: Distance calculated once, reused
4. **Smart Notifications**: Only checks when conditions met

## Known Limitations

1. **Mock Data**: Coordinates are hardcoded for LA beaches
2. **No Backend**: Location not persisted or shared
3. **Notification Radius**: Fixed at 5km (could be user-configurable)
4. **Single Notification**: Only notifies once per session
5. **Web HTTPS Required**: Geolocation requires secure context

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] User-configurable notification radius
- [ ] Background location tracking during cleanups
- [ ] Route optimization for multi-event cleanups
- [ ] Geofencing to auto-check-in at events
- [ ] Share location with team members
- [ ] Historical location heatmaps
- [ ] Directions to events (Google Maps navigation)
- [ ] Offline maps with cached tiles
- [ ] Event search by drawing on map
- [ ] Custom map styles (ocean theme)

## Cost Estimates

**Google Maps API** (with $200/month free credit):
- Maps JavaScript API: ~28,000 free loads/month
- After free tier: $7 per 1,000 loads
- For small app: Likely stays free

**Capacitor**:
- Free and open source
- No usage limits or costs
